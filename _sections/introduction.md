I here unfold my understanding and experience of immigration. 
I can be poetical or technical sometimes 
but what I really intend is 
to prepare you mentally to endure the challenges of living on foreign soil.

It is needed knowledge, 
versatility and 
empathy. 
The knowledge repels anxiety. 
The versatility prepares you to deal with the unexpected. 
And the empathy soothes your heart 
in a moment when your body is 
on a high alert state of stress 
face the novel.
