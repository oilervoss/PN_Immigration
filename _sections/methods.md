title: "Newborn"
order: 3

Once in the target country, 
you need to understand you are a newborn here. 
Although you can be very known in your former country, 
you don't have a history here. 

No one, 
not even you, 
knows how you will act under pressure, 
under unfamiliar circumstances. 
An employer, 
a higher hierarchy person, 
doesn't know if you will thrive or shatter. 
You also don't. 

Remember: 
you are an infant again, although one with a really mature mind. 
You are learning to live again in this alien place 
and the place is learning on you.

There is no ferry to heaven.
Bad people exist in all world 
and this country that doesn't know you, 
doesn't identify if you are one of the good ones.

The magic worlds to thrive as foreign are "be in the other's shoes". 
Better saying, 
to thrive through life.
If the border official act so suspicious on you, 
understand how much they are demanded to do not fail.
If the clerk approaches you with indifference, 
understand that maybe they were mistreated by a harmful manager. 
It isn't all on foreign ones, 
isn't all on you. 
Some people are just very injured, beaten by the hardships of living.
