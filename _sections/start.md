I would say the immigration happens in either three extents. 
The short extent appears through Tourism Visas, 
Transit Visas 
and Parents Visas. 
The mid extent appears via 
Student Visas 
and Work Visas. 
The long one rises by 
Permanent Residency 
and Citizenship. 

Nowadays, 
Transit Visa has been seldom solicited. 
It concedes restrict authorization for 
you put your foot outside an airplane on an international airport 
while forbidding you to leave it.

Tourism Visa concedes authorization to enter a country 
with the sole purpose of tourism. 
You can't attend training, 
classes 
neither work, 
even unpaid volunteering. 

Parent Visa is a kind of tourism visa 
for parents 
and relatives of owners of long extent visas.

On all of these three, 
you are a mere visitor, 
a ghost with no civil rights 
beyond the primary ones.

Student Visa 
and Work Visa 
has a longer length, 
although still very delimited. 
Usually, 
they concede some civil rights to the foreign. 
You can be stripped from them 
for plentiful reasons 
although there are foreigns living abroad for several decades on just work visas. 

The Permanent Residence, 
called Green Card in the USA, 
normally concedes the same rights of a citizen 
but electoral or international ones. 
You can vote neither be a candidate. 
Other countries won't still consider you a national. 
Also, 
frequently, 
it limits your freedom of leaving the country.

Naturalization, 
or getting citizenship, 
makes you equal to a national 
hardly lacking a few rights. 
For example, 
you can't be elected president 
or prime minister in many countries.

In Canada, there is no Student Visa for shorter than six months. 
Hence, in these cases, education is done on a Tourist Visa.

Immigration always starts in your original country. 
Either fleeing the war or getting your passport. 
It demands cautious planning and resources. 
Even escaping, one shall save food for the road. 
At each border, you will be evaluated as well you must assess your choices and own behaviour. 
I should say you must start assessing even before that. 
Your beliefs can raise some red flags in some countries. 
This can be inferred by what and how you act on social networks. 
In other words, by your posts and pictures.
