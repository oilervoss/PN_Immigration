What many people don't perceive is that the process of getting a visa doesn't end at the consulate but it continues at the airport. 
The Visa is just a pre-clearance. Is the border official who will decide if you can enter the country.

My personal experience started visiting the USA. And that started getting the passport. The latter is just the tip of an extensive process. 

There are a lot of forms to fill in to ask for a passport.
Even longer are the forms to ask for a Visa and a lot of questions where you could ruin your process with a misguided answer.
Every step will cost you fees and hours. Hours on the computer filling in the forms and sending documents and days waiting for deadlines and appointments for interviews.

On my very first international crossing, the last question the officer asked me was how much money I was bringing.  I mixed thousands and hundreds (I still do) and answered 200 dollars. The officer just nodded I could enter the final gate to the USA soil. I was wondering why he wasn't afraid I wouldn't have enough money for the visit. Later I learned they are concerned with people bringing more than ten thousand dollars undeclared and anyone with credit cards would thrive with no money bill.

On my first visit to Canada, I brought a lot of paper to present at the border.  The officer got a little alarmed and asked if I was expecting trouble to be so prepared.

These officers are public servants, at least comparable to one. They are highly demanded by their superiors but many times they don't have enough training. Public service is similar in all world.

After a visit to the USA, I was returning to Canada when an officer yelled at me how I was trying to enter Canada without a visa. Undisturbedly I answered that it wasn't required of Brazilian tourists anymore, that the ETA should suffice. The very anxious long discussed on the phone with some colleague and finally let us cross. Detail: on the official immigration website of Canada is written that the ETA shouldn't be printed because it's electronic. But I have acquaintances that were prevented from taking their flights because they didn't present it on paper. I'm certain that night crossing the border would be my fate if I didn't have it.

On another occasion, entering the USA by ground, I was pretty sure I was going to be arrested because the officer told me I shouldn't be on the second level inspection considering I already had a stamp on my passport. The officer demanded that I clarified why was segregated by the first screening to the second level if wasn't to get the routine stamp. Fortunately, the woman kept the passport opened on the page and I was cold enough to understand her mistake. The stamp was from the previous year! She was misled by the huge coincidence of dates. I was visiting the USA, from Canada, on the same border, on the same day, after one full year. I paid for a new stamp and we all laughed at the remarkable conjunction.

We did by ourselves the process to obtain a USA Tourist Visa, a Canadian Tourist Visa, a Quebec CAQ and a Canadian Student Visa. This last one was denied by a monstrous mistake. I know because I asked for the  GCMS ATIP and checked what the clerk wrote. I guess I was evaluated between shifts because none of what was on my file could apply to me. Probably was a stupid mistake of Cut and Paste. Control C, control V. Or expired prescription glasses so they mixed one line with the following.

An appeal to a decision on a visa is nothing more than asking for it again. This time I hired a consultant because at least they could intervene at some point and would ask for double-checking what they were doing. The consultant used all the same documents and forms I had sent. This time the clerk fixed their glasses and I got the student visa. 

I need to point out that the Quebec CAQ was issued with the wrong date too. Weighing that an appeal would be paying and waiting for it again, I choose to use it on the Federal visa as it was. Months later I had to ask for an extension of the CAQ and the Federal visa.
